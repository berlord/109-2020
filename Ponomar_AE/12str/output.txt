There are many hypotheses for the origin of the 
name “Big Ben”.   
    The most popular one suggests that the bell 
was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who was 
responsible for the installation. Some of people 
say he was really tall and that’s why this bell 
is called big, but the majority believe it is 
called Big because of its size.          
    Big Ben is one of the best-known landmarks in 
Europe. Nowadays the word Big Ben connects the 
bell, the clock and the tower at the same time. 
The tower is closed to the general public,  but 
people with a "special interest" might offer an 
excursion for additional payment.
